# Udacity-Project-4-MusicalStructure
This project introduced me to concept of planning and structuring an app. This was the first project that required a use of multiple Activities
and an ability to move between them. For this project I have chosen to add Buttons to each activity and use Explicit Intent to move in 
between each Activity. 

This project also required an additional research in how to use a payment API. Since this is a more advanced topic, I only did a brief research
on PayPal API and tried to explain how I would use it in a real app.
